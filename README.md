# Run me
Standard create-react-app scripts, you know what to do ðŸ˜‰\
- yarn install
- yarn start
npm is obviously fine too.

## Storybook
I often like to use storybook for the component aspect of any app, be it react, angular, or otherwise.\
I feel this helps to encourage a more single responsibility and uncoupled method of writing components, before needing to consider functionality.
